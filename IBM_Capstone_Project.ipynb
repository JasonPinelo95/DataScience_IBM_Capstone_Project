    "One of the hardest things to find out when people are neophyte and want to start a bussiness is to decide or find what would be the best bussines category to start with. Not many people have the economic solvency to open and close business in short amount of time. For that reason, it is important for people to have certainty about their business, i.e.,to not close in first months of their business life. For what I mentioned above, I will take on the task of helping young people or any person that want to start a business to find what type of business are more likely to survive and have the best incomings."

At the moment they have three major places in where to start, those places are located in the city of Mérida, Yucatán in México. My task here will be to find the best business categories arround the places they are suggesting in order to recommend them one or various business categories that they can start with. Also, in case they decide to start with one specific category I will try to explore in which neighborhoods there are similiraties in order to give them more places to start with their business. One more thing to take in consideration for this work I am assuming that there are a strong positive correlation between the popularity of a place or business and the income they perceive."
